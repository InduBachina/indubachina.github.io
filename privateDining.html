        <p class="intro">Visitors are immersed in an interactive journey from the time they arrive. This begins with our
            hosts' greetings and continues with the sounds of our specially chosen background music. Regional India's
            colorful food is interpreted in a modern, appealing manner by SONA. Our refreshments menu, which includes
            seasonal G&Ts, is influenced by Indian culture and spirit. The best flavors and ingredients are used to
            create contemporary takes on time-honored classics. Our gorgeous private dining room is the perfect place to
            celebrate all types of special occasions, from delightful breakfasts to dinner parties.</p>
